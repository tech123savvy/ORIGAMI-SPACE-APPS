		can make it sleeping bag cum storage units . 
			suggested idea:
			making the sleeping bag in three to four segments , connecting all of them together using zips. when not in use, it can be used as four different compartments which can be opened and closed using zips .( Zips can be 3d printed )
		
		can minimize the volume these sleeping bags take up when not in use
		
		Each bed consists of a padded board with a fireproof sleeping bag attached to it. Astronauts zip themselves inside the sleeping bags, generally leaving their arms out. Crew quarters also provide each astronaut with an individual light, communications station, fan, sound-suppression blanket, and sheets with weightlessness restraints for those who find the sleeping bags too warm.

		The size of the bunk beds are more than six feet long by 30 inches wide, consisting of a padded board with a fireproof sleeping bag attached to it with ventilation made from perforations. On Earth, the board would feel hard, but because the near weightlessness of space, it feels soft.

		At night, the astronauts climb into their sleeping bags and zip themselves up, with their arms outside the bag. Around the waist is a strap that goes around the waist, with each sleeping compartment containing a light for reading and side panels that can be shut for privacy with eyeshades and earmuffs.
		
		the sleeping unit which consists of the sleeping bag, the small reading light etc can be made foldable. (photo uploaded)
